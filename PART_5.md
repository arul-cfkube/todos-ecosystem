## Build and Deploy Todo(s) CQrS  

This Part focuses on building and deploying a CQrS system within the Todo(s) EcoSystem.  Once deployed it's possible to route Creating, Updating and Deleting Todo(s) to the Command Microservice and Reads to the Query one.  [The primary function of CQrS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) is to seperate read and write logic and that's what this Part will accomplishe without a lot of fanfare.
